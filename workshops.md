#East Bay JavaScript Meetup Group
https://www.meetup.com/EBJavaScript
Show off some of the cool projects you've been working on and talk about everything happening in the JS community. Let's share tips, tricks, hacks and frameworks! We don't have a JavaScript group in the East Bay so I thought I'd start one. Our first topic is an intro to Node. Come check it out!
